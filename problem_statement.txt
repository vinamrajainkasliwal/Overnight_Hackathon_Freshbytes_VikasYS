India spends over ₹70,000 crores every year on agricultural input subsidies such as fertilizers, seeds, and farming equipment. However, a significant portion of these subsidies does not reach genuine farmers due to widespread leakage and misuse.

Subsidy leakage occurs because of:

Ghost farmers created using fake identities or mismatched land records

Black-market diversion where dealers supply subsidized materials to non-farmers

Over-claiming subsidies by farmers with smaller landholdings than what is declared

Manipulation of land documents and absence of real-time verification

Lack of a unified, verified farmer identity, enabling duplication and fraud

Delayed audits that detect issues only after the crop season is over

Currently, the government has no centralized, intelligent system to authenticate farmers, verify land ownership, monitor subsidy distribution, or detect suspicious claim patterns across districts and dealers.

Core Problem:

India needs a real-time, verifiable, and intelligent subsidy monitoring system that links farmer identity, land records, and subsidy transactions — and can automatically detect anomalies and potential fraud before subsidies are misused.
